## Presentation Guideline
For Paper Presentation, the presenter should upload the following files to each given folder:

- *Report*: briefly summarize the paper. It should be structured as a memo, including introduction, related work, solution, experimental results, major conclusions, pros and cons.
- *Demo*: an interactive Jupyter Notebook / Colab to show visualize the result of the paper. For most paper, it's highly recommended that you download the source code of the paper, running the main model and see the results or visualization in this notebook.
- *Slides*: which you use to present at the course. It should contain both the contents of the report and some key results of the code demo.
- *Quiz*: 3 questions about this paper. Please send me the question bank one day before the class, and provide answers and feedback.

Every audience should participate in Q&A after the presentation, and finish the quiz (homework) using the quiz link after the course.
